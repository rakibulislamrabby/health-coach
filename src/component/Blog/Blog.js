                <p className='ps-3'>Authentication</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is usually performed before the authorization.</li>
                    <li>Authentication is the first step of authorization so always comes first.
                    </li>
                    <li>Authentication is the process of identifying a user to provide access to a system.</li>
                    <li>It requires the login details of the user, such as user name & password, etc.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Authorization</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is usually done once the user is successfully authenticated.</li>
                    <li>Authorization is done after successful authentication.</li>
                    <li>Authorization is the process of giving permission to access the resources.</li>
                    <li>It requires the user's privilege or security level.</li>

                <h5>2. Why we are using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h5>
                <p>Firebase can be seen as a server-less backend for your mobile apps or web apps, etc. It is a service provided by Google. Firebase can be used when you do not want to spend a lot of time developing your own backend. It can be used for rapid development.</p>

                    <li>Web Development Made Easy</li>

                </ul>
                <h6>The other options of implement authentication</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>JWT token use: JWTs are used as a secure way to authenticate users and share information. Typically, a private key, or secret, is used by the issuer to sign the JWT. The receiver of the JWT will verify the signature to ensure that the token hasn't been altered after it was signed by the issuer</li>

                    <li>oAuth: Integrating OAuth 2.0 into your app has several benefits: It allows you to read data of a user from another application. It supplies the authorization workflow for web, desktop applications, and mobile devices. Is a server side web app that uses authorization code and does not interact with user credentials.</li>
